read ORM (hibernate)  (write it in txt file)
 *      a. lazy loading vs eager loading
 *      b. why ORM

a. Lazy loading means the program delay the initilization of the resource while eager 
loading initilize the resource as soon as possible (usually while executing
the code, but sometimes it could preload some related resources.

Take retrieving data as an example. Lazy loading save some performance because it 
only load the data when necessary. But if the instance will be used multiple times,
taking lazy loading might force the program to retrieve the each data mutiple times.

In such case, using eager loading could save time because it load all the related
resource at once.

b.ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a technique to connect Object_oriented
and Relational Database. So, when manipulate the data, you don't use SQL but actually
interact with the data as an object.

Pros: Everything kept in one place so easier to update and maintain. It's more flexible
because it allow you to use coding language you're familiar with and apply OOP, which is
a natural way of thinking. It's efficient because it abstract the database and manipulating
data just like using methods in a program.

Cons: But it could lower the performance of the program since it's just use OOP as a bridge
to connect sql. So it couldn't be better than using sql directly. And since it abstract 
everything, the foundation of database became unreachable, you couldn't personalize your own
sql.
